Welcome! This repository hosts my personal website and portfolio. I built this space to serve as a long-term archive of my professional journey, technical projects, and life memories and thoughts that I find worth sharing. I treat it as a place where I can document the code I write and the experiences I want to remember. I treat this site as a living document-constantly evolving as I learn new things. I hope you find something interesting. Thanks for stopping by !!
